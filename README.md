# Progetto Javascript Basics di Andrea Brandetti

Hi, in this readme I will show you how I realized this counter application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## HTML Structure

We have an app container that includes: H1 (name of the app), a div that will contain the counter value and a div cointaing three buttons ("increase", "reset", "decrease").
In the bottom of the page there is a footer with my signature.

## CSS Style

For this project i chose a minimalist CSS style.
Every text is written in "Poppins" sans-serif bold, and the background color is blue. Title and footer color is yellow as the "increase" and "decrease" buttons, "reset" button is red. When a button get hovered his color change. Counter value color is white.

## Javascript functions
